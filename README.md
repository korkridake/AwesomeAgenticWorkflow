# Agentic Workflow

## What Is an Agentic Workflow?

At its core, an agentic workflow is a process in which an LLM acts on behalf of users to perform tasks or provide assistance. These workflows leverage a model's capabilities to act as an intelligent intermediary between users and the information or services they require, enhancing productivity, efficiency and user experience. 

Traditionally, Large Language Models (LLMs) have only been able to generate content using next word prediction and one-shot generation, with LLMs lacking a mechanism to iterate or review their own output. This method of using LLMs is sometimes called “frozen” model-based generation.

Where previously a mechanism called ‘function calling’ has been used to allow developers to describe the functions and actions that these models take, like performing calculations, or making an order, Agentic AI frameworks can now leverage this function-calling capability, allowing LLMs to handle complex workflows with much more autonomy and generate better quality output.
